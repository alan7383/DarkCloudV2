# DarkCloud: Soundcloud Night Mode

**DarkCloud** is a browser extension that applies a dark theme to Soundcloud for a more enjoyable nighttime viewing experience.

This project is a fork of the [original created by IEVEVO](https://github.com/IEVEVO/darkcloud). I've resolved a few issues and added improvements.

## Prerequisites

- **Compatible Browser**: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

## Installation

### For Google Chrome

1. Download the ZIP file of the extension from [the releases page](https://github.com/alan7383/darkcloud/releases).

Next, unzip your .zip file using a decompression tool like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=10), for example. Then, go to Chrome, click on the three dots, go to Extensions, and manage extensions.

Then, you will be on this page, enable Developer Mode and click on Load unpacked extension.

Next, select "darkcloud-master" (the decompressed folder, not the zip file) and click on "Select Folder."

And that's itâ€”you have the extension installed on Chrome.
