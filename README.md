# DarkCloud: Soundcloud Night Mode

**DarkCloud** is a browser extension that applies a dark theme to Soundcloud.com for a better nighttime experience.

This project is a fork of the [original project by IEVEVO](https://github.com/IEVEVO/darkcloud). I have resolved a few issues and made some improvements.

## Prerequisites

- **Compatible Browser**: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

## Installation

### For Google Chrome

1. Download the ZIP file of the extension from [the releases page](https://github.com/alan7383/darkcloud/releases).
