# DarkCloud: Soundcloud Night Mode
Browser extension that changes soundcloud.com to a dark theme.

updated for manifest V3, **and comments issue fixed**

It's a fork of the [original project by IEVEVO](https://github.com/IEVEVO/darkcloud), and I've resolved a few issues. 

# How To Install?

Start by clicking on release and downloading "darkcloud-master.zip"

Next, unzip your .zip file using a decompression tool like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=10), for example. Then, go to Chrome, click on the three dots, go to Extensions, and manage extensions.

Then, you will be on this page, enable Developer Mode and click on Load unpacked extension.

Next, select "darkcloud-master" (the decompressed folder, not the zip file) and click on "Select Folder."

And that's itâ€”you have the extension installed on Chrome.
